    # Eidos - Abstract System Modeler

    Eidos is a desktop application for visually modeling and simulating complex abstract systems using a hybrid flowchart/mindmap approach with AI-driven transitions.

    ## Features

    *   Visual node-based modeling
    *   Directed links for flow and influence
    *   Support for multimodal data (text, images, audio, ...) associated with nodes
    *   Execution engine with RestrictedPython sandboxing for node logic
    *   AI-powered transition decisions between nodes based on data and user specs
    *   Persistence (Save/Load models as JSON)
    *   Undo/Redo functionality
    *   Panning/Zooming canvas
    *   Cross-platform (planned)

    ## Installation

    1.  **Prerequisites:**
        *   Python 3.9+
        *   (If applicable) Git
    2.  **Clone the repository (Optional):**
        ```bash
        git clone [your-repo-url]
        cd Eidos
        ```
    3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        # Windows
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        # macOS/Linux
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    4.  **Install dependencies:**
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    5.  **(IMPORTANT) API Key:** Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with your key, or edit `config/settings.ini` (less secure).

    ## Usage

    Run the application from the project root directory:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    *   Use the toolbar to switch between Select, Add Node, Link Nodes, and Execute modes.
    *   Double-click nodes to edit properties.
    *   Use File menu to Save/Load models.
    *   Click 'Execute Flow' mode and then click a node to start simulation.

    ## Development

    *   Run tests: `python -m unittest discover tests`
    *   Package application: `pyinstaller Eidos.spec` (after editing the spec file)
